# Style

* Use 4 **spaces** for tabs

# Workflow

* No pushing directly to `master`
* Include issue (if applicable) **at the begging** of commit message: `(#ISSUE_NUMBER)`
For example, a commit message related to adding a licence, which
also closes the issue would be something like:
```	
(#1) Add LICENCE
Added a licence. Closes #1.
```
* If you are working on something, create an issue (if it does not exist yet) and assign
it to yourself (to make sure that there is no duplicate work)


Feel free to alter this file. If you want to change something, please create an issue,
so that all of the members are aware of the change.
